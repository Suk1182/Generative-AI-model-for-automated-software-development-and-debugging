# Generative-AI-model-for-automated-software-development-and-debugging

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Youâ€™ll need a dataset of code examples, debugging logs, and refactored code. Some sources to consider are:

GitHub Repositories: Extract code snippets from open-source projects.
Public Datasets: Look for code-related datasets such as the CodeSearchNet(https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet) dataset.
Synthetic Data: You can generate synthetic data by writing code snippets and manually adding bugs or refactoring examples.

Training Considerations: Training large models like GPT-2 or GPT-3 requires significant computational resources. You may need to use cloud-based solutions like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
Debugging and Refactoring: Implementing these features would require more sophisticated logic, possibly using another fine-tuned model or custom algorithms.
Ethics and Safety: Ensure that your model is safe to deploy, especially when generating code, as it might introduce vulnerabilities.
